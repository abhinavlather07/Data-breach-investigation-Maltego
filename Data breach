Here in this project i have worked upon to find breached accounts of individuals.
These accounts were related to some financial institution.
Due to lack of security base the company was not able to protect the data of individuals.
The breach data included emails of different individuals.
The breach attack was carried by not only a single company but by different companies all together.
The company whose accounts were breached and the person names can be seen in my project video which i have uploaded on LinkedIn.
